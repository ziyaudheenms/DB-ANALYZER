DB ANALYZER: The Ultimate Solution for Interacting with Databases in Human Language
üìå Project Overview
DB ANALYZER is a cutting-edge solution designed to bridge the gap between non-technical users and complex database operations. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models, this application allows users to interact with their databases using simple, natural human language, eliminating the need for any knowledge of SQL commands.

üí° The Problem
In many business environments, individuals responsible for data analysis‚Äîsuch as store managers or business officers‚Äîoften need to retrieve specific information from databases like PostgreSQL. However, these users may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with complex SQL queries, making it a significant barrier to accessing crucial data and insights.

‚úÖ The Solution
DB ANALYZER provides a powerful and intuitive interface where users can simply ask questions in plain English. Our system takes care of the rest:

It automatically converts the human language prompt into a valid SQL command.

It executes the command on the database.

It refines the raw database output into a clear, human-readable response.

This streamlined process empowers non-technical users to independently retrieve the information they need, enabling faster decision-making and greater operational efficiency.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Frontend UI: Streamlit (Python-based framework)

Core Logic: Python with the LangChain framework

Large Language Model: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Breakdown
‚û°Ô∏è SQL Database Executor
This module is designed for interaction with SQL databases, particularly PostgreSQL.

Connection: The user provides their PostgreSQL database connection string.

Analysis: Our agent connects to the database, analyzes its structure (tables and column names), and processes the user's natural language query.

Command Generation & Execution: The agent generates the appropriate SQL command and executes it on the database.

Refinement: The raw database response is passed to our Refiner Agent, which is responsible for transforming the data into a clean, human-readable format.

‚û°Ô∏è CSV File Executor
This module provides similar functionality for local CSV files, making it a versatile tool for quick data analysis.

Upload: The user uploads their CSV file.

Conversion: The agent converts the CSV data into a temporary SQLite database (a best practice recommended by LangChain).

Querying & Visualization: The agent analyzes the user's query, generates a response, and automatically creates a graphical representation (e.g., a bar chart) to visualize the data.

Insight Generation: The system also provides a detailed analysis and insights derived from the CSV file.
